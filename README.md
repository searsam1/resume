Programming Languages
:   **Python:** About 3 years ago I realized watched the movie "Swordfish" 
    and realized I want to work with computers all day. I taught myself 
    how to code in python by doing challenges for 55 days straight 
    and then some.

:   **C++:** While this language is newer to me and it is much harder
    to me than python, I figured id learn it to get the concepts 
    of low level stuff like memory management. 

:   **C#:** I learned this because I wanted to become a IOS developer, 
    so I wanted to learn C# to use with Xamarin to make cross platform apps. 

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **JS**, **R**
